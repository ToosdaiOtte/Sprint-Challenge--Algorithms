#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - loop will take longer to finish as n increases


b) O(n^2) - there is a loop within a loop


c) O(n) - recursive so dependent on number of inputs

## Exercise II

A binary search would be best, where you drop the egg from the middle floor down and if it doesn't break then you can discard the first half.  Then "drop" the egg in the middle of the top half, halving each time to the top or bottom depending on whether the egg did or did not break.

O(log n)
